## CIS Department Junior Seminar Contract

The CIS Department Junior Seminar offers the opportunity to learn and practice various research
methods and prototyping skills in advance of completing a department Senior Project. This document
outlines the expectations held regarding student performance in the Junior Seminar and the required
deliverables.

### Contract provisions

#### Meetings

Students agree to attend course sessions. This fundamental requirement contemplates that any student
who misses more than 3 class sessions may have their grade for the course lowered by `1` letter grade.
Work done during these sessions may include:

* discussion
* peer review
* writing
* diagramming
* developing or troubleshooting experiments
* giving and/or observing a presentation

All readings, expected outcomes, and deliverables are communicated via the [course calendar](https://chompe.rs/580-schedule).

#### Evaluation

This course is evaluated using the `Project Portfolio` as a source of truth. The majority of assignments will be
long-running, multi-step projects. These are evaluated using the following weights:

|Element |Weight |
|:-------|:------|
|`Research Roadmap`s | 25% |
|`Presentation Log`  | 25% |
|`Final presentation`| 20% |
|`Research Log`      | 15% |
|`Process Log`       | 15% |
|                    |     |
|Total               |100% |

_All posts must be tagged correctly in order to count toward their corresponding requirement._

##### `Research Roadmap`s

Students are expected to complete `Research Roadmap`s via FigJam for each of the three major research projects
included in the [Syllabus](README.md). Students will be given access to a FigJam instance for each project. Upon conclusion
of each "mapped" project unit, students will be required to post pictures and/or shareable links to the roadmaps
they've created. The complexity of the maps will increase over the course of the semester. Posts for `Research Roadmap`s will 
vary by assignment; each assignment will contain the requirements for the final `Roadmap` post.

Each `Roadmap` will receive a final letter grade based on both meeting the post requirements defined in the unit assignment
and based on the completeness of the map. The following symbols will be used to evaluate posts and maps _separately_:

|Assessment |Point value | Comment |
|:----------|:-----------|:--------|
|✅        |        `+1` |Most elements present, goes beyond surface-level conclusions |
|🟩        | `+.5`       |A fair amount of steps or elements missing, responses lack depth |
|❌        |   `+0`      |Many elements are missing, responses to questions do not contain key details or are missing |

A given `Roadmap` post might be scored:

|Element | Assessment |
|:-------|:-----------|
|Map     |✅          |
|Post    |🟩          |

leading to a score of `1.5`. All assessment will be accompanied by a short explanation.

##### `Presentation Log`

> Note: Presentations will be given starting on the Monday of `Week 2`, and will continue weekly throughout the semester.

On at least a bi-weekly basis, students will give _maximum_ `5` minute presentations (unless otherwise specified). These will be scored
by the use of an "`up`/`down`" class vote form. These forms will change to reflect presentation expectations which will be distributed on
the Wednesday before a student's presentation to allow adequate time for preparation. Each presentation will feature at least `2` skills
or primary focuses.

Student and instructor feedback will be weighted according to the following matrix to arrive at a final grade:

|Respondent |Weight |
|:----------|:------|
|Students   | `25%` |
|Instructor | `75%` |

Each student is expected to present `7` times throughout the semester. Each presentation should be uploaded to a students' `Project Portfolio`
with a short review of presentation performance using the skills/focuses listed in the presentation assignment as the main substance for the post.

###### `Final presentation`

Each student will present one final (`8th`) time during the  course's designated final period. This presentation will be attended by department faculty
and is subject to an `up`/`down` vote based on project feasibility and the faculty's assessment of quality of work completed. This presentation is
essentially a "pass"/"fail" grade in which a majority of faculty must vote in favor of the project's viability.

##### `Research Log`

> Note: This requirement will not start until `Week 2`, and will continue weekly throughout the semester from that point.

Starting from `Week 2`, students will be required to write a short post annotating a single novel research article relevant to the course project on
which they are currently working. Students in a group _may not_ use the same article, and must choose separate articles to annotate. Annotation posts:

* must have the title of the article as the post title which
  * features a correct citation included both in the post _and which_
  * is contained in the `references.bib` file using `ACM` format
* must feature a `250` work annotation which:
  * describes how the researcher found the article
  * establishes the authors' authority and credibility
  * briefly summaries of the article's main point(s)
  * describes of the relevance/value of the article to the project at-hand

Each complete post garners `+1` point toward a maximum of `12` points.

##### `Process Log`

Each Friday, our class will meet alongside `CIS 610`. These meetings will feature activities for both sets of students which differ, but are related.
Posts to a students' `Process Log` will be included and described in the [`CIS 600/610 Course Slide Deck`](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QDbWdCCGryctqeVki0hznGVqXQBHrpKEbhyudKiXuHQ/edit?usp=sharing).
This slide deck is updated weekly for Friday sessions. `Process Log` posts are due by the Monday course following the previous Friday session. These 
posts are often related to activities with tangible outcomes and will require both the activity in question to be complete and a `150` word (minimum)
post made in response to an accompanying prompt.
