## CIS Department Junior Seminar Contract

The CIS Department Junior Seminar offers the opportunity to learn and practice various research
methods and prototyping skills in advance of completing a department Senior Project. This document
outlines the expectations held regarding student performance in the Junior Seminar and the required
deliverables.

### Contract provisions

#### Meetings

Students agree to attend course sessions. This fundamental requirement contemplates that any student
who misses more than 3 class sessions may have their grade for the course lowered by `1` letter grade.
Work done during these sessions may include:

* discussion
* peer review
* writing
* diagramming
* developing or troubleshooting experiments
* giving and/or observing a presentation

All readings, expected outcomes, and deliverables are communicated via the [course calendar](https://chompe.rs/580-schedule).

#### Evaluation

This course is evaluated using the `Project Portfolio` as a source of truth. The majority of assignments will be
long-running, multi-step projects. These are evaluated using the following weights:

|Element |Weight |
|:-------|:------|
|`Research Roadmap`s | 35% |
|`Presentation Log`  | 25% |
|`Research Log`      | 25% |
|`Process Log`       | 15% |
|                    |     |
|Total               |100% |

##### `Research Roadmap`s

Students are expected to complete `Research Roadmap`s via FigJam for each of the three major research projects
included in the [Syllabus](README.md). Students will be given access to a FigJam instance for each project. Upon conclusion
of each "mapped" project unit, students will be required to post pictures and/or shareable links to the roadmaps
they've created. The complexity of the maps will increase over the course of the semester. Posts for `Research Roadmap`s will 
vary by assignment; each assignment will contain the requirements for the final `Roadmap` post.

Each `Roadmap` will receive a final letter grade based on both meeting the post requirements defined in the unit assignment
and based on the completeness of the map. The following symbols will be used to evaluate posts and maps _separately_:

|Assessment |Point value | Comment |
|:----------|:-----------|:--------|
|✅        |        `+1` |Most elements present, goes beyond surface-level conclusions |
|🟩        | `+.5`       |A fair amount of steps or elements missing, responses lack depth |
|❌        |   `+0`      |Many elements are missing, responses to questions do not contain key details or are missing |

A given `Roadmap` post might be scored:

|Element | Assessment |
|:-------|:-----------|
|Map     |✅          |
|Post    |🟩          |

leading to a score of `1.5`. All assessment will be accompanied by a short explanation.

##### `Presentation Log`

> Note: Presentations will be given starting on the Monday of `Week 2`, and will continue weekly throughout the semester.

On at least a bi-weekly basis, students will give _maximum_ `5` minute presentations (unless otherwise specified). These will be scored
by the use of an "`up`/`down`" class vote form. These forms will change to reflect presentation expectations which will be distributed on
the Wednesday before a student's presentation to allow adequate time for preparation. Student
