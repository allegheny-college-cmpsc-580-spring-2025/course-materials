## Syllabus

> I remember the first time in my life when I spent more than 10 hours on a problem and actually got the answer.
> When you start out in life, when you start doing something that you don’t know, you think of a question and then
> you answer it. First then you discover that oh, the Greeks already had done that. Then you learn a few more
> things, and you ask some more questions, and you say oh yeah, this was done in the 17th century, the 18th
> century, 19th century. Finally you get to something that, for the first time in your life, you discovered
> something that, as far as you know, nobody had discovered before.

### Canonical course description

An investigation of select topics in computer and information science that prepares students for the completion of a senior project 
with the purpose of identifying knowledge gaps in the discipline. Students learn how to read scholarly papers, state and motivate 
research questions, create a software prototype or develop scholarly artifacts to address their findings, and collect and organize 
evidence for evaluating the outcome of their project. During a weekly laboratory session students use industry-grade technology to 
gain practical skills in technical writing, the presentation of technical concepts, and the production of an artifact.

### Course learning objectives

- Illustrate a component of a viable and appropriate open-source research project idea.
- Identify appropriate sources to motivate the research idea and determine research project objectives.
- Demonstrate feasibility of a research idea through an application of existing computational resources.
- Describe a research idea, its motivation, goals, and anticipated outcomes in writing.
- Present and communicate complex ideas in a variety of media through both informal discussions, peer reviews, and formal presentations.

#### Platforms

This course relies on your regular use of:

* [GitHub](https://github.com)
* [Discord](https://discord.com)

### Evaluation

#### Project Portfolio
This course relies a student-maintained `Project Portfolio` which is comprised of four (4) parts:

1. `Research Roadmap`
2. `Presentation Log`
3. `Research Log`
4. `Process Log`

Each of these are semester-long projects that have interim due dates to assess student progress. Each week, students are required to make substantive
progress on _all_ parts of their `Project Portfolio`. The journal takes the form of a Quarto-powered web site to which students contribute weekly materials.

##### Research Roadmap

Students in this course are required to keep a `Research Roadmap`, an account of progress achieved and anticipated for their chosen projects. This is
a tool meant to demonstrate your overall plan at a glance. In this course, these roadmaps will take the form of a few documents:

- a GitHub Project plan defining tasks and due dates, maintained by each student in response to course prompts
- a visualization of the roadmap produced three (3) times throughout the semester
- a description of the starting point and final goal of the research plan represented with:
  - a topic summary
  - a research question

Students are expected to update these roadmaps as they undertake or finish tasks involved in developing projects, and will receive guidance about
which parts to finish at key times in the research process. Overall, this product should accurately reflect successes, failure, stops, starts, and
the overall shape of the process that takes place during this course.

##### Presentation Log

This course also gives students multiple opportunitites to develop their presentation skills. This course contemplates weekly presentations given
on Mondays. Each presentation is a short demonstration of research or skills progress in developing and presenting an idea, increasing in complexity
over the course of the semester. They, however, share one rule: presentations must be under `5` minutes in length (unless otherwise noted). Students
are assigned to a presentation schedule. Prompts will be given for these presentations and they will relate to the work undertaken in the prior 
week. See the [Course Contract](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for evaluation details.

##### Research Log

As a part of developing presentations and overall project completeness, students will keep an annotated research journal which posts links to, summaries of,
and annotations about a wide variety of sources that motivate their project. Students are expected to have worked through at least `15` individual entries
on research resources. Keep in mind that different kinds of tasks or problems may necessitate very different kinds of research, a topic that this course 
covers in discussions on what kinds of sources are considered authoritative. Keep in mind that the [Course Contract](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) contains evaluation
details.

##### Process Log

Independent of the required presentation and research schedules for the course, students will be assigned weekly posts that reflect on and describe their
overall project process.
