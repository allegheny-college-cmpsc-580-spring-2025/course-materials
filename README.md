## Syllabus

> I remember the first time in my life when I spent more than 10 hours on a problem and actually got the answer.
> When you start out in life, when you start doing something that you don’t know, you think of a question and then
> you answer it. First then you discover that oh, the Greeks already had done that. Then you learn a few more
> things, and you ask some more questions, and you say oh yeah, this was done in the 17th century, the 18th
> century, 19th century. Finally you get to something that, for the first time in your life, you discovered
> something that, as far as you know, nobody had discovered before.

### Canonical course description

An investigation of select topics in computer and information science that prepares students for the completion of a senior project 
with the purpose of identifying knowledge gaps in the discipline. Students learn how to read scholarly papers, state and motivate 
research questions, create a software prototype or develop scholarly artifacts to address their findings, and collect and organize 
evidence for evaluating the outcome of their project. During a weekly laboratory session students use industry-grade technology to 
gain practical skills in technical writing, the presentation of technical concepts, and the production of an artifact.

### Course learning objectives

- Illustrate a component of a viable and appropriate open-source research project idea.
- Identify appropriate sources to motivate the research idea and determine research project objectives.
- Demonstrate feasibility of a research idea through an application of existing computational resources.
- Describe a research idea, its motivation, goals, and anticipated outcomes in writing.
- Present and communicate complex ideas in a variety of media through both informal discussions, peer reviews, and formal presentations.

### Platforms

This course relies on your regular use of:

* [GitHub](https://github.com)
* [Discord](https://discord.com)
* [Figma](https://figma.com)

### Structure

This course is structured in two units:

1. Reproducing a published research project
2. Defining your own research project

These units split the semester roughly in half, using Spring Break as the demarcating line between units.

### Evaluation

#### Project Portfolio

This course relies a student-maintained `Project Portfolio` which is comprised of four (4) parts.

1. `Research Roadmap`s
2. `Presentation Log`
3. `Research Log`
4. `Process Log`

Each of these are semester-long projects that have interim due dates to assess student progress. Each week, students are required to make substantive
progress on _all_ parts of their `Project Portfolio`. The journal takes the form of a Quarto-powered web site to which students contribute weekly materials.

##### Research Roadmap

Students in this course are required to keep `Research Roadmap`s for the various experiments we will do in this course. These are tools meant to demonstrate 
your overall plans, attempts, and research connections at a glance. Students are expected to update these roadmaps as they undertake or finish tasks involved 
in developing projects, and will receive guidance about which parts to finish at key times in the research process. Overall, this product should accurately reflect
successes, failure, stops, starts, and the overall shape of the process that takes place during this course.

Each of these roadmaps must be completed in `FigJam` (Figma).

###### 1 Billion Loops project

Students will complete this project independently.

- a description of the starting point and final goal of the research plan represented with:
  - a topic summary
  - an articulation the original research question behind the experiment
- a visualization of the roadmap of steps taken to reproduce the experiment
  - any additional resources consulted in order to complete the project, including:
    - generative prompts
    - "how-to" guides
  - inclusion of paths/processes that lead to dead-ends or failures

###### Discipline-specific project

Students will complete this project in a team assigned to you based on your chosen discipline (degree program).

- a description of the starting point and final goal of the research plan represented with:
  - a topic summary
  - two research questions:
    - an articulation the original research question behind the experiment
    - an original research question not posed by the experiment which suggests a new direction of study
- a visualization of the roadmap of steps taken to reproduce _one experiment_ in the assigned paper, including:
  - steps to create the process
  - any additional resources consulted in order to complete the project, including:
    - generative prompts
    - "how-to" guides
    - additional research necessary to understand concepts accounting for relationships between sources
  - inclusion of paths/processes that lead to dead-ends or failures

###### Independent research project

Students will complete this project independently <sup>†</sup>.

- a description of the starting point and final goal of the research plan represented with:
  - a topic summary
  - an original research question motivating the need to do the research
- a visualization of the research process undertaken in the course including:
  - a relationship diagram of sources cited, with links to annotation posts
  - a process diagram of an experiment used to prove viability of research topic with an emphasis on reproducibility
  - d
  - inclusion of paths/processes that lead to dead-ends or failures

<sup>†</sup> Students in the Computer and Information Science (CIS) department may attempt team or group Senior Projects.
If you choose to pursue the final research project as a team, the expectations for this project reflect the level of complexity and
depth incumbent on projects with more resources. Student _do not_ need to be in the same degree program to form a Senior Project group (e.g.,
a Data Science and Computer Science major can attempt a project together, et al.). If you choose to complete a group project in this course,
be aware that you are indicating your interest in continuing this group through your `600` and `610` work.

##### Presentation Log

This course also gives students multiple opportunitites to develop their presentation skills. This course contemplates weekly presentations given
on Mondays. Each presentation is a short demonstration of research or skills progress in developing and presenting an idea, increasing in complexity
over the course of the semester. They, however, share one rule: presentations must be under `5` minutes in length (unless otherwise noted). Students
are assigned to a presentation schedule. Prompts will be given for these presentations and they will relate to the work undertaken in the prior 
week. See the [Course Contract](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for evaluation details.

##### Research Log

As a part of developing presentations and overall project completeness, students will keep an annotated research journal which posts links to, summaries of,
and annotations about a wide variety of sources that motivate their project. Students are expected to have worked through at least `15` individual entries
on research resources. Keep in mind that different kinds of tasks or problems may necessitate very different kinds of research, a topic that this course 
covers in discussions on what kinds of sources are considered authoritative. Keep in mind that the [Course Contract](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) contains evaluation
details.

##### Process Log

Independent of the required presentation and research schedules for the course, students will be assigned weekly posts that reflect on and describe their
overall work on a given project and its relationship to developing sound research projects. Often, these posts will coincide with work done during joint
sessions held with the students in the `610` course and will require reflection and synthesis of work completed on `580` and discussion with researchers
in `610`. These posts are due on Mondays, as reflected by the [Course Calendar]().

### Course preparation

I expect students to arrive to class prepared. Here, "prepared" means having completed reading assignments, compiled questions, 
and being ready to engage thoughtfully with course material. In order to assist students' preparedness efforts, I will provide a 
[schedule](https://chompe.rs/404-schedule) with assignments and accompanying materials or readings.

### Allegheny College Statement of Community

Allegheny College also expects students and faculty to act according to its Statement of Community:

> Allegheny students and employees are committed to creating an inclusive, respectful and safe residential learning community 
> that will actively confront and challenge racism, sexism, heterosexism, religious bigotry, and other forms of harassment and 
> discrimination. We encourage individual growth by promoting a free exchange of ideas in a setting that values diversity, trust 
> and equality. So that the right of all to participate in a shared learning experience is upheld, Allegheny affirms its commitment 
> to the principles of freedom of speech and inquiry, while at the same time fostering responsibility and accountability in the 
> exercise of these freedoms. This statement does not replace existing personnel policies and codes of conduct.

### Honor Code

All students and faculty at Allegheny College are bound by the Honor Code. Everyone expects that your behavior reflects this commitment. Given the eminently shareable and reproducible nature of code, the Department of Computer Science adds the following statement to the general college policy:

> It is recognized that an important part of the learning process in any course, and particularly in computer science, derives from 
> thoughtful discussions with teachers, student assistants, and fellow students. Such dialogue is encouraged. However, it is necessary 
> to distinguish carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others, and the student who 
> produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone else’s work. It will therefore be understood that all 
> assignments submitted to faculty of the Department of Computer Science are to be the original work of the student submitting the assignment. 
> Appropriate action will be taken when assignments give evidence that they were derived from the work of others.

The above statement, of course, also applies to solutions derived from discussions on Stack Overflow and other similar resources.

#### AI tools

I fully expect that many of you will use tools like OpenAI's GPT code completion, GitHub Co-pilot, and others on assignments. These are professional, industry-grade tools and are closely integrated in some of the platforms we will use. However, there is a marked difference between implementing the solutions these tools suggest and copying their suggestions wholesale. In many cases, these tools will lead you to either incorrect or significantly advanced answers. As one might say in the consumer trade, _caveat emptor_.

One of the goals of your time in this class, much less at Allegheny, is to learn how the subjects discussed in classes relate and impact your future work. While there are many ways that your assignments will test your understanding of the concepts underlying our coursework, I ask a few of things from you completely aware that you are fully on your own honor with any of these:

* be prepared to explain a detailed understanding of the code you're offering for review, documenting where and how you used an assistant tool in:
  * technical reports
  * code comments, specifically labeling the portions of code derived from use of AI tools
* consider how you might improve an assistant-generated solution, documenting this in reports and implementing your improvements in code
* keep an operating assumption that I'm not reviewing your solutions for a "gotcha"; I only assume the best of your effort

### Classroom ethics

The discipline of computer science, like many others, encourages its members to act according to discipline-specific ethics. I encourage you to take time to review the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) [Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/about/acm-code-of-ethics-booklet.pdf).

### Seeking assistance

#### Assistance with course concepts

Students who struggle to understand knowledge and skills defined in this course are encouraged to seek assistance from instructional staff. To meet with me, consult my available office hours (above) and make an appointment.

Historically, students who are successful in my courses visit and discuss course concepts with instructors or TLs early and often. See [above for my office hours](#office-hours) or go to [this schedule for Technical Leaders' office hours](https://www.cs.allegheny.edu/teaching/technicalleaders/).

#### Assistance outside of the course

If you find yourself in difficult circumstances which affect your ability to participate in or complete course work, let me know immediately. Full stop.

Do not wait until the end of the semester. 

*It is part of my job* to make sure that students receive the assistance they need. Do not hesitate to let me know if there is anything I can do with respect to your ability to handle your work. This is especially true of our current circumstances. Again, let me remind you -- __**it is part of my job**__ to help you access Allegheny College resources that will enable your safety and success.

In many situations, the following list of resources may help:

* [The Maytum Learning Commons](https://sites.allegheny.edu/learningcommons/)
* [Allegheny College Counseling Center](https://sites.allegheny.edu/learningcommons/)
* [The Winslow Health Center](https://sites.allegheny.edu/healthcenter/)
* [Student Life](https://sites.allegheny.edu/studentlife/)

### Special needs and disability
