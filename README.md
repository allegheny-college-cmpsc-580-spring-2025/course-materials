## Syllabus

> I remember the first time in my life when I spent more than 10 hours on a problem and actually got the answer.
> When you start out in life, when you start doing something that you donâ€™t know, you think of a question and then
> you answer it. First then you discover that oh, the Greeks already had done that. Then you learn a few more
> things, and you ask some more questions, and you say oh yeah, this was done in the 17th century, the 18th
> century, 19th century. Finally you get to something that, for the first time in your life, you discovered
> something that, as far as you know, nobody had discovered before.

### Canonical course description

An investigation of select topics in computer and information science that prepares students for the completion of a senior project 
with the purpose of identifying knowledge gaps in the discipline. Students learn how to read scholarly papers, state and motivate 
research questions, create a software prototype or develop scholarly artifacts to address their findings, and collect and organize 
evidence for evaluating the outcome of their project. During a weekly laboratory session students use industry-grade technology to 
gain practical skills in technical writing, the presentation of technical concepts, and the production of an artifact.
