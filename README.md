## Syllabus

> I remember the first time in my life when I spent more than 10 hours on a problem and actually got the answer.
> When you start out in life, when you start doing something that you donâ€™t know, you think of a question and then
> you answer it. First then you discover that oh, the Greeks already had done that. Then you learn a few more
> things, and you ask some more questions, and you say oh yeah, this was done in the 17th century, the 18th
> century, 19th century. Finally you get to something that, for the first time in your life, you discovered
> something that, as far as you know, nobody had discovered before.

### Canonical course description

An investigation of select topics in computer and information science that prepares students for the completion of a senior project 
with the purpose of identifying knowledge gaps in the discipline. Students learn how to read scholarly papers, state and motivate 
research questions, create a software prototype or develop scholarly artifacts to address their findings, and collect and organize 
evidence for evaluating the outcome of their project. During a weekly laboratory session students use industry-grade technology to 
gain practical skills in technical writing, the presentation of technical concepts, and the production of an artifact.

### Course learning objectives

- Illustrate a component of a viable and appropriate open-source research project idea.
- Identify appropriate sources to motivate the research idea and determine research project objectives.
- Demonstrate feasibility of a research idea through an application of existing computational resources.
- Describe a research idea, its motivation, goals, and anticipated outcomes in writing.
- Present and communicate complex ideas in a variety of media through both informal discussions, peer reviews, and formal presentations.

#### Platforms

This course relies on your regular use of:

* [GitHub](https://github.com)
* [Discord](https://discord.com)

### Evaluation

This course relies on three (3) major mechanisms:

1. `Research Roadmap`
2. `Presentation Portfolio`
3. `Research Portfolio`

Each of these are semester-long projects that have interim due dates to assess student progress. All of these constitute a holistic `Class Portfolio`,
which takes the place of a formal final exam.

#### Research Roadmap

Students in this course are required to keep a `Research Roadmap`, an account of progress achieved and anticipated for their chosen projects. This is
a tool meant to demonstrate your overall plan at a glance. In this course, these roadmaps will take the form of a few documents:

- a GitHub Project plan defining tasks and due dates, maintained by each student in response to course prompts
- a visualization of the roadmap produced three (3) times throughout the semester
- a description of the starting point and final goal of the research plan represented with:
  - a topic summary
  - a research question

Students are expected to update these roadmaps as they undertake or finish tasks involved in developing projects.

#### Presentation Portfolio

This course also gives students multiple opportunitites to develop their presetnation skills.
