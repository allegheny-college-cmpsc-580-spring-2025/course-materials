### Canonical course description

An investigation of select topics in computer and information science that prepares students for the completion of a senior project 
with the purpose of identifying knowledge gaps in the discipline. Students learn how to read scholarly papers, state and motivate 
research questions, create a software prototype or develop scholarly artifacts to address their findings, and collect and organize 
evidence for evaluating the outcome of their project. During a weekly laboratory session students use industry-grade technology to 
gain practical skills in technical writing, the presentation of technical concepts, and the production of an artifact.
